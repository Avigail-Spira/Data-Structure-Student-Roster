# Data-Structure-Student-Roster

In this project, I created a data class called **Student** to maintain information for registration.  
The **studentRecord** class extends student and has an ArrayList of courses for each student.  

* *equalsTo* checks the equality of student Ids   
* *compareTo* alphabetizes students by their names   
* *toString* returns a “formatted” string for the student name and ID
